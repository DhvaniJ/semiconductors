      <h2>Holes and Electrons in Semiconductors</h2>
      <p>Holes and electrons are the types of charge carriers accountable for the flow of current in semiconductors. Holes (valence electrons) are the positively charged electric charge carrier, whereas electrons are the negatively charged particles. Both electrons and holes are equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity.</p>

      <h2>Mobility of Electrons and Holes</h2>
      <p>In a semiconductor, the mobility of electrons is higher than that of the holes. It is mainly because of their different band structures and scattering mechanisms.

        Electrons travel in the conduction band, whereas holes travel in the valence band. When an electric field is applied, holes cannot move as freely as electrons due to their restricted movement. The elevation of electrons from their inner shells to higher shells results in the creation of holes in semiconductors. Since the holes experience stronger atomic force by the nucleus than electrons, holes have lower mobility.</p>

        <h3>Band Theory of Semiconductors</h3>
        <p>
          The introduction of band theory happened during the quantum revolution in science. Walter Heitler and Fritz London discovered the energy bands. We know that the electrons in an atom are present at different energy levels. When we try to assemble a lattice of a solid with N atoms, each level of an atom must split into N levels in the solid. This splitting of sharp and tightly packed energy levels forms Energy Bands. The gap between adjacent bands representing a range of energies that possess no electron is called a Band Gap.

      <h2>Properties of Semiconductors</h2>
      <p>Semiconductors can conduct electricity under preferable conditions or circumstances. This unique property makes it an excellent material to conduct electricity in a controlled manner as required.

          Unlike conductors, the charge carriers in semiconductors arise only because of external energy (thermal agitation). It causes a certain number of valence electrons to cross the energy gap and jump into the conduction band, leaving an equal amount of unoccupied energy states, i.e., holes. The conduction due to electrons and holes is equally important.</p>
